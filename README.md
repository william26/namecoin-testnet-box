This can be used as a private testnet for namecoin, and is to be included in a docker container.

It has been inspired by freewil's work here https://github.com/freewil/bitcoin-testnet-box.

There are two nodes for the moment, and we premined with a low difficulty to get about 120 blocks, for the first 50 nmc to be available in node 1.
